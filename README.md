Operator to Surround a Text Object
==================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rhysd/vim-operator-surround.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rhysd/vim-operator-surround)

This plugin provides Vim operator mappings to deal with surrounds like `()`, `""` and so on.
In addition, both end of the text object are the same character, vim-operator-surround recognizes them as a surround (this behavior is customizable with some variables).

It can
- surround a text object with a specified block.
- replace a surround in a text object with a specified block.
- delete a surround in a text object.

This plugin is more useful with [vim-textobj-multiblock](https://github.com/osyo-manga/vim-textobj-multiblock), [vim-textobj-between](https://github.com/thinca/vim-textobj-between) or [vim-textobj-anyblock](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-textobj-anyblock).
And you can customize and add surround definitions in global and filetype specific scope.

## Policy of This Plugin (or The Reason Why I Don't Use [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround))

- **Simplicity** : All should be done with operator mappings.
- **Extensibility** : The behavior should be highly customizable with `g:operator#surround#blocks` and text objects like [vim-textobj-multiblock](https://github.com/osyo-manga/vim-textobj-multiblock), [vim-textobj-between](https://github.com/thinca/vim-textobj-between) or [vim-textobj-anyblock](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-textobj-anyblock).
- **Well-tested**


## Requirements

This plugin uses [vim-operator-user](https://github.com/kana/vim-operator-user). Please install it in advance.

## Customize

Set your favorite blocks to `g:operator#surround#blocks`. And control the behavior with some variables.

## Example of `vimrc`

```vim
" operator mappings
map <silent>sa <Plug>(operator-surround-append)
map <silent>sd <Plug>(operator-surround-delete)
map <silent>sr <Plug>(operator-surround-replace)


" delete or replace most inner surround

" if you use vim-textobj-multiblock
nmap <silent>sdd <Plug>(operator-surround-delete)<Plug>(textobj-multiblock-a)
nmap <silent>srr <Plug>(operator-surround-replace)<Plug>(textobj-multiblock-a)

" if you use vim-textobj-anyblock
nmap <silent>sdd <Plug>(operator-surround-delete)<Plug>(textobj-anyblock-a)
nmap <silent>srr <Plug>(operator-surround-replace)<Plug>(textobj-anyblock-a)

" if you use vim-textobj-between
nmap <silent>sdb <Plug>(operator-surround-delete)<Plug>(textobj-between-a)
nmap <silent>srb <Plug>(operator-surround-replace)<Plug>(textobj-between-a)
